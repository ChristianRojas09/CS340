# Animal Shelter Web Application

This application is built using Python and MongoDB. The application consists of a database, RESTful API CRUD handler, and a UI. The Database contains information about animals in an animal shelter including: breed, age, location, name, and unique ID. The API is a handler that manages the database, allowing the user to create, read, update, or delete data. The front-end displays a table with all animal data. The application also uses the Google Maps API to geotrack each animals location, and provides a map view in the UI.
